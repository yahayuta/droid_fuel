# droid_fuel

This project is a Flutter migration of an original Android application for analyzing fuel usage.

## Original Android App Description
The original Android application "droid_fuel" was designed to help users track and analyze their vehicle's fuel consumption. It allowed users to:
- Record odometer readings, fuel amount, and fuel price.
- View a list of all recorded fuel usage entries.
- Edit existing fuel usage records.
- Export fuel usage data (e.g., to a CSV format).
- Reset all stored data.
